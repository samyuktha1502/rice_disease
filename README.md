# Rice Leaf Disease Detection


This project focuses on detecting diseases in rice leaves using machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze leaf images and classify them as healthy or diseased by applying image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification methods.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and result visualization to support early disease identification in agriculture.
